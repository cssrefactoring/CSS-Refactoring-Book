      img {
        float: left;
      }
    </style>

      <span>
        This is text that I am going to float around an image.
        <img src="http://placekitten.com/96/139" alt="Image of a kitten" />
        Notice how the image floats to the left and the rest of the text just
        seems to magically wrap itself around? Pretty sweet, eh?
